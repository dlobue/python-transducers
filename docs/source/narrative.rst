``transducer`` Introduction
===========================

Current the best description of ``transducer`` can be found in our series of articles
`Understanding Transducers Through Python <http://sixty-north.com/blog/series/understanding-transducers-through-python>`_.
The code developed over the course of these articles is substantially
the same as in this ``transducer`` package, although the package uses
some further abstractions and tools which are largely irrelevant to
understanding how transducers work.
