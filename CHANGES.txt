Changes
=======

transducer 0.7
--------------

Simplified and clarified much of the implementation.

Dropped support for Python 3.2.

Much clearer reduction to single values for transducers such as first()
and last() in conjunction with the expecting_single() reducer.


transducer 0.6
--------------

Correctness fixes by moving function locals in the transducer factories
to be class attributes of the transducers.  This allows transducers
returned by the transducer factories to be safely used more than once.

Renamed transducer.transducer to transducer.transducers.

Relocate reducing functions to reducers.py

Move transducer infrastructure to infrastructure.py


transducer 0.5
--------------

Initial release
