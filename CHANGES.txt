Changes
=======

transducer 0.6
--------------

Correctness fixes by moving function locals in the transducer factories
to be class attributes of the transducers.  This allows transducers
returned by the transducer factories to be safely used more than once.

Renamed transducer.transducer to transducer.transducers.

Relocate reducing functions to reducers.py

Move transducer infrastructure to infrastructure.py


transducer 0.5
--------------

Initial release
